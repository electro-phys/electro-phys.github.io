Cool paper from the Bastos lab

> An established theoretical model, predictive coding, states that the brain is constantly building models (signifying changing predictions) of the environment. The brain does this by forming predictions and signaling sensory inputs which deviate from predictions (“prediction errors”). Various hypotheses exist about how predictive coding could be implemented in the brain. We recorded neural spiking and oscillations with laminar resolution in a network of cortical areas as monkeys performed a working memory task with changing stimulus predictability. Predictability modulated the patterns of feedforward/feedback flow, cortical layers, and oscillations used to process a visual stimulus. These data support the theory of predictive coding but suggest an alternate model for its neural implementation: predictive routing.
